Revolve is a light-weight library for building applications with a robust and composable architecture. It is a Redux-based and leverages the power of the Combine framework to streamline your app's state management and UI development. Designed specifically for SwiftUI, Revolve makes creating efficient, maintainable, and enjoyable applications easier than ever.

## What is Revolve?

Revolve is a modern architecture library for SwiftUI apps, which leverages Redux and Combine to manage your app's state, actions, and side effects. The library enables you to build clean and maintainable applications, making it easier to test, scale, and reason about your code.

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ Swift Package Manager support
- ðŸ”— Composable reducers and state
- ðŸ’ª Type-safe actions using enums
- ðŸ§ª Easily testable with CombineSchedulers

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Handasatic/Revolve.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

## Examples

We provide several examples of how to use Revolve in different scenarios:

* [Basic Example](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Revolve/tree/main/Examples/BasicExample) - A simple example demonstrating the core concepts of Revolve.
* [Advanced Example](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Revolve/tree/main/Examples/AdvancedExample) - A more complex example, showcasing how to handle advanced use cases and app features with Revolve.

## Basic usage

Here's a quick example to get you started with Revolve:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Revolve

// 1. Define your app state
struct AppState {
    var counter: Int = 0
}

// 2. Define your app actions
enum AppAction {
    case increment
    case decrement
}

// 3. Implement the reducer
let appReducer = Reducer<AppState, AppAction> { state, action in
    switch action {
    case .increment:
        state.counter += 1
    case .decrement:
        state.counter -= 1
    }
}

// 4. Create the store
let store = Store(initialState: AppState(), reducer: appReducer)

// 5. Use the store in your SwiftUI views
struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var store: Store<AppState, AppAction>

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Counter: \(store.state.counter)")
            Button("Increment") {
                store.send(.increment)
            }
            Button("Decrement") {
                store.send(.decrement)
            }
        }
    }
}

// 6. Provide the store to your SwiftUI app
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView(store: store)
        }
    }
}
```
